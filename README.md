# PRA
This is a C program implementing the four different page replacement algorithms FIFO, Clock, LRU, and Optimal. The program is written in a fairly linear fashion, first it will prompt the user for the number of requested frames, then it will load the file pages.txt, print it the file contents, and perform the 4 algorithms.
Here is an example of what your pages.txt file should look like.
pages.txt
1 2 3 4 1 2 5 1 2 3 4 5
